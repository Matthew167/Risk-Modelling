# Risk Modelling

## What are these R files? 

In our here, you will find the practical R exercises I did in preparation for my CS2 Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis exemption. 

These files were coded in Rstudio version: 
RStudio 2024.04.2+764 "Chocolate Cosmos" Release (e4392fc9ddc21961fd1d0efd47484b43f07a4177, 2024-06-05) for windows Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) RStudio/2024.04.2+764 Chrome/120.0.6099.291 Electron/28.3.1 Safari/537.36, Quarto 1.4.555

## Why are these R files important? 

The exercises I completed were not part of any South African university curriculum; they were conducted through the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA). These exercises are set to an international standard, exceeding the level covered at the University of Witwatersrand, demonstrating my proficiency in R for the professional environment.
